    My name is Grace Kim. I was born on January 24, 2003. I'm in the eighth grade. I have an older brother and older sister. My brother is in college, while my sister is in high school. My favorite music group is EXO. They were formed by SM Entertainment, and debuted on April 8, 2012. They began their activities with EXO-K and EXO-M. They began with 12 members, but currently have nine, as three left. My favorite member is Do Kyungsoo. His stage name is D.O.
